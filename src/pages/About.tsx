          Ever since <b>P-Side</b> dropped his first drum loop in GarageBand on his friendâ€™s iMac in 2009, he was instantly hooked. He immediately proceeded to beg his mom for an acoustic guitar that christmas. Slowly, his janky beats and clumsy strumming fledged themselves out. His musical horizons grew with his desire to create and perform.
